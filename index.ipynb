Recall that when training neural networks, the model is tuning a huge number of weights: several to dozens at each individual layer. Often the largest limiting factor with these models is the quality and size of the training data you have at hand. As such, adapting a pretrained model from a similar problem context that was trained on a larger dataset can lead to stronger overall models when you have limited training data. For example, in image recognition, the VGG-19 network is commonly used to improve the model performance of CNNs with limited training data. VGG-19 was trained on the ImageNet dataset which contains approximately 1.2 million images. Since the initial bottom layers of a CNN pick up small details with later layers picking up larger and larger features, the initial layers of a well trained network are applicable to other problem domains. Similar pretrained networks exist for other domains such as natural language processing as well. With that, let's take a further look at how transfer learning works in detail.\n", "\n", "## Objectives\n", "\n", "You will be able to:\n", "\n", "- Describe the benefits of using pretrained networks \n", "- Explain how pre-trained neural networks are used for feature extraction \n", "- Explain what \"freezing\" and \"unfreezing\" a layer means in a neural network \n", "\n", "## Why are pretrained convolutional bases useful?\n", "\n", "A commonly used approach when performing deep learning on fairly small image datasets is to use pretrained networks. A pretrained network is a network which was previously ran on a large, general dataset, and saved. The advantage is that the hierarchical features learned by this network can act as a generic model, and can be used for a wide variety of computer vision tasks, even if your new problem involves completely different classes of images.\n", "\n", "Recall from earlier that more general features such as edges are detected in earlier layers. Due to this, these convolution layers are highly generic and reusable. Layers that are further down the model extract more abstract concepts, so for new datasets with very different objects to classify, you might want to use only the first layers of the model, and not the entire convolutional base. \n"]}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}, "source": ["## Exampled of pretrained networks \n", "\n", "Keras has several pretrained models available.

In addition, fine tuning also works by retraining the frozen weights for the convolutional base. This allows these weights to be tweaked for the current scenario, hence the name. To do this, you'll freeze part of the model while tuning specific layers. \n", "\n", "## Additional Resources\n", "\n", "* http://cs231n.stanford.edu/schedule.html\n", "* https://www.dlology.com/blog/gentle-guide-on-how-yolo-object-localization-works-with-keras/\n", "* https://www.dlology.com/blog/gentle-guide-on-how-yolo-object-localization-works-with-keras-part-2/ \n", "\n", "## Summary \n", "\n", "In this lesson we introduced the concept of using pretrained neural networks as a starting point for future models. The idea is that well trained CNNs have generalized visual patterns that are transferable to new applications. For example, a previously trained model might have hidden convolutional layers that effectively identify edges, or even more complex patterns such as eyes which may have value in new domains. In the upcoming lab, we'll further explore how to implement these concepts in Keras."]}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3", "language": "python", "name": "python3"}, "language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "file_extension": ".py", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "version": "3.7.3"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 2}
